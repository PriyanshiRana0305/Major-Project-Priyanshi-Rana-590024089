Project Overview

The Quiz Game is a straightforward console application created using C programming, which enables users to evaluate their general knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. This project illustrates essential programming principles such as conditional statements, loops, character manipulation, and validation of user input. The game presents various questions, collects responses from the user, computes the score, and offers feedback on performance based on the results.

Guidelines

Compile and run the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).

The game will begin by displaying a welcome message, followed by multiple-choice questions.

For each query:

Select an option (A, B, C, or D).

The program will automatically change any lowercase input to uppercase for consistent comparison.

Once all questions have been answered:

The ultimate score will be shown.

A feedback message will be provided based on your score:

Perfect Score: Outstanding! You've achieved a perfect score!

High Score: Great work! However, there’s room for improvement.

Some Correct: You answered a few questions correctly. Keep up the practice!

Zero Correct: No worries! Give it another try, and you’ll improve!
